
Note: When writing your own GS with Minimal GS as boilerplate you
can of course erase this changelog and replace it with your own.

Version 2:
- Add: Provide EnfOfMonth and EndOfYear methods that get called from
  main loop every month/year
- Add: Greet players using SuperLib.Story.ShowMessage which will
  use the Story Book in recent enough trunk versions but fall back
  to the blue query window in older trunk and 1.2-1.3.
- Add: Detect if the OpenTTD version used has the World Gen Bug and
  apply counter measures so that it doesn't affect the script. 
  If World Gen bug is detected, it will delay script initialization
  to after world gen.
- Add: readme.txt and changelog.txt
- Change: Move greeting of new players to event handler (works also
  in multiplayer)
- Change: Replace Helper.Max() with built in max() method
- Change: Make it more clear that you may insert your own name as
  author in info.nut
- Fix: If parsing loaded data did not complete when Save() is called,
  save in-memory copy of loaded data
